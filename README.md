# README

Creates a [Wallace](https://github.com/wallace-js/wallace/) starter app, either in JavaScript or TypeScript.

This package should be run as:

```
npx create-wallace-app
```

Rather than:

```
npm init wallace-app
```

As the latter will use locally cached version if found.

The version of this package indicates the version of Wallace initially installed, and you may want to update.
