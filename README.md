# README

Creates a [Wallace](https://github.com/wallace-js/wallace/) starter app, either in JavaScript or TypeScript.

This package should be run as:

```
npx create-wallace-app
```

Rather than:

```
npm init wallace-app
```

As the latter will use locally cached version if found.

You will be asked to specify:

1. Which directory to create the project in.
1. Whether you want TypeScript or JavaScript.
1. The project name.

It will then create a project with a minimal app skeleton, webpack and the latest version of Wallace.
